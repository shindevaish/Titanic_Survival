# Titanic_Survival

## Titanic Survival Prediction
This project analyzes the __Titanic Dataset__ to predict passenger survival using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to explore data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation to find the best-performing classifier.

## 🧩 Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction Project applies different classification models on the Titanic dataset.
The dataset includes passenger details such as age, gender, class, and ticket information, which are used to predict the likelihood of survival.

## ⚙️ Features
- __Data Exploration & Visualization (EDA)__: Understand data distribution and correlation using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

- __Data Cleaning__: Handle missing values and irrelevant columns.

- __Feature Encoding__: Convert categorical variables like Sex and Embarked into numerical form.

- __Feature Scaling__: Apply standardization using StandardScaler.

- __Model Training__: Compare multiple classifiers using scikit-learn.

- __Performance Evaluation__: Measure model accuracy against gender_submission.csv

## 📁 Dataset Files
- __train.csv__ – Training dataset with features and labels (Survived column).

- __test.csv__ – Test dataset for predictions.

- __gender_submission.csv__ – File containing ground truth survival labels for evaluation.
